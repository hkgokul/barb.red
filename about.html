      <h2 class="section-label">OUR STORY</h2>
      <p>BARB was born from the passion of people who truly love creating beautiful work, the kind that feels precise, quiet, and alive. Being trained in architecture and guided by an eye for design detail, we push every project we get beyond “just okay” to something breathtaking.</p>
      <p>We like staying small and not chasing size. It keeps us close to the work, close to the craft, and close to why we started this in the first place. Fewer projects, done right, mean more to us than a bigger list.</p>
      <p>That belief sits at the heart of everything we build, draw, and render.</p>

      <h2 class="section-label">WORKFLOW</h2>
      <p>We work comfortably across platforms Revit, SketchUp, 3ds Max, and industry standard software so you can share your ideas in whatever form they exist: a detailed model or a sketch on a piece of paper.</p>
      <p>Once shared, we rebuild and refine from the inside out, aligning scale, proportion, and light before adding materials or detail. Every step is layered, saved, and easy to retrace.</p>
      <p>Our process is collaborative. We share progress openly - from clay renders and design drafts to the final Visualizations. You’ll always know where your project stands and how it’s evolving.</p>
