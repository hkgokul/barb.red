      <h2 class="section-label">Our Story</h2>
      <p>We didn’t sit down to design a “foundation.” We noticed things that shouldn’t be hard and yet were. A clinic where every sound bounced back at anxious people. A school with no shade at noon. A doorway that said “not for you” to anyone on wheels.</p>
      <p>We saw rooms meant for comfort and encouragement, but they left people tense and tired. That feeling stayed with us long enough and drove us into action.</p>
      <p>Since then, our measure has been simple: does this help someone breathe easier here? We listen, we adjust, we finish, and we leave a record so the next space—school or clinic—doesn’t have to start from scratch.</p>

      <h2 class="section-label">Mission</h2>
      <p>We research, build, and advocate for small, well-designed public works that uphold dignity and make care easier.
      Our focus is practical: quiet clinics, counselling rooms, accessible routes, sanitation, shade, and safe water built fast, documented clearly, and shared so others can replicate and improvise.</p>
      <p>We partner early with schools, primary health centres, campuses, and local bodies to scope what will actually change daily life. We plan around exam calendars and clinic hours, use locally serviceable materials, and publish scope, cost, and photos when we finish. Our target is ≤10% cost/time variance on every site.</p>
